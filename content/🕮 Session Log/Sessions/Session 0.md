- Set everything up!
	- ~~Connect to the server via ZeroTier~~ (Done!)
	- ~~Set up your character sheet~~ (Done!)
	- ~~Check you cant access anything you shouldn't be able to~~ (Done!)
- Learn how to use the VTT!
	- ~~Combat encounter!~~ (Done!)

### Recap:

A short Setup session to help everyone get into the VTT. Introduced the tools available I.e. measurement and ping. 

A short combat encounter occurred that had the party fight a group of bandits in a colosseum. This gave the party a chance to test their combat capabilities and figure out how to use their features.

### Things the party should know:

- You can measure out distance for movement using the ruler - Pressing space while having a route plotted out automatically moves the character to the end position.
- You can ping on the map using middle click. 

### Areas explored:

- The colosseum
	- A mystical colosseum that draws in fighters from everywhere and nowhere. Nobody knows where it's located, and many people believe it exists outside of time entirely. Fighters are regularly drawn in and expelled on a whim.
