This optional rule makes it easier for a creature to be felled by massive damage.

When a creature takes damage from a single source equal to or greater than half its hit point maximum, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer a random effect determined by a roll on the System Shock table. For example, a creature that has a hit point maximum of 30 must make that Constitution save if it takes 15 damage or more from a single source.

|1-4|    The creature is Stunned until the end of its next turn.
|5-8|    The creature can't take reactions and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.
|9-12|    The creature can't take reactions until the end of its next turn.
