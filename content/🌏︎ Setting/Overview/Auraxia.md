### Name of the known world
---
Auraxia is the continent the setting takes place on. This is simultaneously the name of the kingdom- "Kingdom of Auraxia". 
This quirk is due to the fact that Auraxia is the only known continent in the dome, and many people (typically of shorter lifespans) believe the legends of previous continents beyond the dome to be mere fairy-tales.  

There is a [[World Map|World Map]] of the known cities and layout of Auraxia, however much of the world is not explored in detail- the land beyond the mountain rings has been abandoned due to its harsh conditions and abundance of monsters.
