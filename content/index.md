###  üëì About

These are my notes for my DND Campaign - The Firmament. It details public information about the setting, core NPCs and other player characters, and keeps a track of Quest Threads (that the party is aware of at least). 

The history of the world is also detailed, typically from the perspective of a common persons recollection of the world - however for brevity's sake I sometimes use modern analogies to get a point across. 

These notes are a WIP! they might not have the most up to date knowledge, but I should be making session logs under #Session or you can see more information in the [[Session Schedule]]. Just give me a quick @ on discord if I've forgotten to add something! I don't bite! (usually)
###  ü™¥ Info

The campaign uses DND 5e with the 2014 ruleset - with plans to update to the 2024 rules for the campaign after this one. House rules can be found under the House rules folder in the Setting folder, or you can use the #HouseRule tag. 

You can find information about Party members in either [[The Party|The Party]] or under #Player. [[The Party]] also contains information about current quests the party is pursuing. 

Info about the world can be found under the Setting folder on the left or you could start with looking at [[Auraxia]]. A map of the world is under [[World Map]].
