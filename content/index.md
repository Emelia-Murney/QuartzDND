These are my notes for my DND Campaign - The Firmament. It details public information about the setting, core NPCs and other player characters. History about the world will also be updated, and Quest threads (that the party is aware of) will be listed in the party page. 

These notes are a WIP! they might not have the most up to date knowledge, but I should be making session logs under #Session or you can see more information about the Session Schedules in 


You can find information about the party in either [[The Party|The Party]] or under #Player.
