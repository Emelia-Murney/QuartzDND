### Description:
---
Transgender sorcerer (he/him) who has an intense hatred for wizards. 

Typically wears a purple cloak- the hood is affixed magically above their head and resists most attempts to be pulled down. The hood blocks any light from passing from their face outwards, giving the appearance of a black void beyond the entrance. This void is only pierced by two glowing orange eyes. 

Under the hood, cash has short black hair and an effeminate face- the cause for most of their woes. Cash is typically adorned by large quantities of jewellery, including gaudy rings and large golden chains around their neck.
