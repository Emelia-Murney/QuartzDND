Ranni Silverplume is one of the shorter species of Owlin, standing at just 127cm, other species can be as tall as 180cm. As her name suggests, she and her family all have silver plumage, peppered with the occasional off-colour feathers. While she is not very strong due to both her small stature and slight overreliance on stronger Wildshapes, she is both dexterous and wise. Often able to think of other ways out of difficult situations. Despite this, Ranni is spattered with small scars and injuries, usually covered by her plumage. However, one scar on her left arm is too large to be covered with feathers, earned by defending Rosewood from a vicious attack from a raiding party of goblinoids. 

Ranni primarily wears simple clothing, light breezy trousers that reach just below her knees, and a soft simple shirt, recently forgoing her leather breastplate due to a magical tattoo enhancing her defences and acquiring long wraps to cover her arms. On top of these, she wears a leather harness for carrying two leather pouches and a bag of holding keeping them close to her body so they don't dangle, as a backpack would obstruct her wings too much and impede flight. And to finish off the look a light, blue cloak adorns her shoulders, a large hood sitting behind her neck, she doesn't often wear it up as Bell (short for Bluebell, her astral kitty) likes to rest there. This cloak has two slits in the back, and a buckle for securing it, these slits allow for her to fly while the cloak is worn. 

While one would suspect it to be hidden by her feathers, Ranni's Barrier Tattoo is visible on top of them, altering the colours of small parts of her feathers to convey the image without obscuring it in any way. The tattoo's appearance is that of vines reaching up and swirling around druidic glyphs. Which, upon translation, reads "shield of the forest", this tattoo is located on her right arm.
