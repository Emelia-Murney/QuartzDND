#Nobility

## Position in the kingdom
---
The king, Currently [[King Aeternus]], is the head position of the royal lineage. 

The order of succession in this world differs from how most kingdoms operate- They have a selection of princes from various families. Historically noble families would debate amongst themselves to decide who was the best fit for the job, being disallowed from advocating for themselves. This means that larger noble families typically form into groups where the smaller noble families will all advocate for a single larger family. Most of the major noble families are heads of one of the guilds, which helps them curry favour with many different people.

However in recent times commoners have made their voices heard and have been given the right to have a say in who rules their lands. This is officially known as the house of commons.
