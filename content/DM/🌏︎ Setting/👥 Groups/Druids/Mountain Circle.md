#Druids
## Druidic Circle based in the Mountain Pass
---
The Mountain Circle is a key sister circle to the [[Rosewood Circle]], The druids of this circle are typically far more combat oriented and are dedicated to keeping the mountain ring of [[content/DM/🌏︎ Setting/Overview/Auraxia]] free of monsters. Due to the difficulty of their job, Mountain druids often are hardened adventurers in their own right, although they have been declining in quantity as of recent years. 

Many druids of the Mountain Circle are originally druids of the [[Rosewood Circle]]- They are usually promoted for exceptional combat capabilities or other key defining traits that lead to them being extremely capable and independent. Mountain druids often travel alone or in pairs, and as such being self-sufficient is a key principle.
