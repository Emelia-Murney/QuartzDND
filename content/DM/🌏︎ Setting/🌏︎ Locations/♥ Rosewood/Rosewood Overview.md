## Capital city of the druids
---
Rosewood is the capital city of the druids. It is built around the [[World Tree]]. 

Rosewood has its own dedicated Druidic circle - The [[Rosewood Circle]]. This circle is responsible for many of the druids that travel around the lands, keeping the balance of nature in check. They are a co-circle to the Mountain Circle.
