### Recap:
---
[[Gaius]], A known retired Adventurer, acted as a Quest fixer - putting [[The Party]] together to complete a simple escort quest and introduce them all to the world of adventuring. 

[[The Party|The party]] members, all here for their own personal reasons, all met up in the [[Mythmaker Tavern]] (Owned by Gaius) and got acquainted. Here they exchanged pleasantries and went over for the last time what they had to do. 

[[Gaius]] reassured them it should be a simple quest, with little risk for them or the researchers they were escorting- the group would be small, and several of the researchers had magic items in order to reduce their presence and provide a bit more stealth, which would mean the party only had to worry about monsters straying upon them at night time. 

[[Gaius]] instructed the party to meet back at[[Mythmaker Tavern| the tavern]] in an hour or so, giving them time to make sure they had everything they needed for the trek ahead. They had to be sure to be on time, as they had to meet with the client - An important woman who respected punctuality and is very influential. There, they would discuss the specifics of the quest and receive details about their rewards.
